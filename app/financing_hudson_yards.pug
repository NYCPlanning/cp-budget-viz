          p.
            Hudson Yards Infrastructure Corporation (HYIC), a not-forprofit local development corporation, was established to provide financing for infrastructure improvements to facilitate economic development on Manhattan&#8217;s far west side. Improvements include the extension of the No. 7 subway line west and south, construction of a system of parks, streets, and open spaces, as well as the acquisition of development rights over the MTA rail yards.            
          p.
            In December 2006, HYIC, issued its first series of bonds in the principal amount of $2 billion. HYIC issued its second issuance of $1 billion of bonds in October 2011. Principal on the HYIC bonds will be repaid from revenues generated by this new development, notably payments-in-lieu-of-property taxes (PILOT) on the commercial development and various developer payments. To the extent these revenues are not sufficient to cover interest payments, the City has agreed to make interest support payments to HYIC subject to appropriation.            
          p.
            Given the ongoing development in the Manhattan&#8217;s far west side, revenues received by HYIC have accelerated. Collections of PILOT revenue and tax equivalency payments continue to increase. Additionally, since January 2017 HYIC received over $20 million from payments in lieu of mortgage recording tax and district improvement bonus. These revenues, along with other revenues, will eliminate the interest support the City would have to provide on the HYIC bonds for fiscal years 2017 and 2018. However, some of these revenues are not ongoing, and the City financial plan reflects appropriation for interest support on the HYIC bonds in the future should recurring revenues be insufficient to cover interest on HYIC bonds.            
          p.
            The No. 7 Subway extension was constructed by the MTA and began service in September 2015. The secondary entrance to this station is currently under construction and is expected to open in the third quarter of calendar year 2018.            
          p.
            Phase I of Hudson Park and Boulevard completed construction and opened to the public in August 2015 and is managed by the Hudson Yards Hell&#8217;s Kitchen Alliance Business Improvement District.
