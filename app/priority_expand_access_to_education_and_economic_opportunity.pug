              h4 Initiative Spotlight: Increasing School Broadband Connectivity
              p Having technology in our classrooms not only makes learning exciting, but also prepares our students to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow. With the technology sector projected to continue to add a large portion of jobs to the economy, having a strong technology foundation is crucial to equipping students with critical skills to be at the forefront of technological innovation. The School ConstructionAuthority&#8217;s 2015-19 5-Year Capital Plan allocates $650 million for technology, $192 million of which is for FY18 alone. Funding will help carve the path for schools to upgrade their broadband internet access to ensure that schools can accept the faster internet speeds. This equipment will facilitate the integration of hands-on and project-based activities into everyday learning, cultivating critical thinking skills and adding significant value to students&#8217; academic growth.

            An $8.9 billion allocation will enable the City not only to repair our aging school buildings and campuses, but also to enhance these facilities by delivering high-speed broadband connectivity in all public schools and providing for investment in new computer labs, gymnasiums, auditoriums, playgrounds, and state-of-the-art university facilities. We are also investing $78 million in the SafeRoutes to Schools program to ensure that areas with heavy student traffic surrounding the school day are safe for children.
          p.
            Strategic investments in developing industries to employ these newly-skilled New Yorkers will complement our investments in education. We are investing to rehabilitate buildings at the Booklyn Navy Yard to create a start-up incubator for technology and manufacturing, creating 500 jobs, while also launching the Brooklyn STEAM Center that will connect an estimated 400 high school juniors and seniors with technical training in software development, culinary arts, engineering, film, construction, and design.The Made in NY campus at Bush Terminal will also be renovated and modernized with an investment of $136million of investment.
