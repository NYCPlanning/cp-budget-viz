        p.
          <b>We will commit significant capital to maintain the diversity and vibrancy of our neighborhoods as we accommodate and promote the city’s growth</b>. New York City’s population surpassed 8.5 million for the first time in 2016 and will reach 9.1 million by 2030. While this growth is good news for the economy and our ability to make strategic capital investments, it also creates new pressures on our communities. We are making supportive investments in growing neighborhoods to create and preserve affordable housing, improve public parks and open spaces, develop better community facilities, and strengthen core infrastructure to promote thriving neighborhoods across the five boroughs. 
        p.
          We will commit $9.4 billion over this capital plan for the development and preservation of affordable housing units and other housing support, including $1.9 billion to make 10,000 homes affordable for more low-income New Yorkers, including seniors and veterans.

            h4 Initiative Spotlight: Housing New York (HNY)
            p Mayor Bill de Blasio has made affordable housing a top priority of his administration and has committed the City to “build or preserve nearly 200,000 affordable units, and help both tenants and small landlords preserve the quality and affordability of their homes.” Since 2014, the Housing New York plan has financed 62,506 affordable homes - breaking records for most new construction financed for a consecutive three years with 20,854 total homes financed. That total includes enough affordable housing to serve more than 160,000 low-income New Yorkers. This Ten-Year Capital Strategy includes $9.5 billion to further meet the City’s commitment to preserving and developing affordable housing. Additionally, the City is making complementary investments in parks, streets, schools, and other infrastructure in areas with significant increases in residential development as part of Housing New York.

          The City’s new Neighborhood Development Fund will ensure that our integrated community-based plans position neighborhoods to prosper today and into the future by coupling zoning changes with necessary infrastructure and facility improvements. After its successful application in East New York, this $1 billion fund will be leveraged in other growing neighborhoods like East Harlem, the Bay Street Corridor in Staten Island, and the Jerome Avenue corridor in the Bronx. 
        p.
          We will improve access to and quality of community parks across the City, providing funding for the Department of Parks and Recreation’s Community Parks Initiative and implementing the innovative Parks Without Borders program. 
        p.
          We will continue our plans for improving the safety and vibrancy of streets in our growing neighborhoods, with $1.5 billion dedicated to the Department of Transportation’s Vision Zero and Great Streets programs which include signal and lighting improvements. 
        p.
          We will green our city and mitigate flooding challenges by capturing and diverting water runoff through the planting of thousands of new curbside gardens, increasing our overall commitment to green infrastructure to a total of $947 million. We are committed to the implementation of a $1.8 billion program to improve drainage and reduce flooding in Southeast Queens through a strategic combination of traditional sewer construction and green infrastructure, while also creating 34 acres of Bluebelt ponds in Staten Island over the next decade for ecologically-sound stormwater management.
