        h1 Maintain our infrastructure in a state of good repair
        p.
          This Ten-Year Capital Strategy allocates $51.3billion to maintaining a state of good repair, one of the largest commitments that the City has ever made. We are prioritizing improvement of our infrastructure and public facilities as the mainstay of both our economy and communities by dedicating more than 50% of our total anticipated capital spending over the next decade to state of good repair, and an additional 21% toward replacement of assets at the end of their useful life.

          We will continue to invest in maintaining and upgrading our roads, bridges, water supply and sewers to modern standards. From FY17 to FY19, we will resurface 1,300 lane miles of streets annually, the highest level in over a decade fulfilling our commitment to improving our streets. And, to complement that investment, we will devote more than $350 million in new funding to street tree-planting. We will dedicate$7.9 billion to repair more than 80 bridges, including all four East River Bridges, and the substantial reconstruction of the BQE Triple Cantilever along theBrooklyn waterfront, a critical thoroughfare for commuters and freight traffic. $18.1 billion will be dedicated to our water supply, sewer, and wastewater systems, including $2.4 billion to maintain the safety and reliability of our water supply, with projects like the$600 million completion of the Brooklyn-Queens leg ofCity Water Tunnel #3. Other new initiatives include more than $3 billion to improve the City’s waste water treatment plants, and over $2 billion for investments in improvements to the City’s upstate infrastructure, such as the Ashokan Reservoir reconstruction.

          We are also focused on improving City-owned buildings– our schools and libraries, recreation and cultural centers, precincts, fire houses, and maintenance facilities.We will invest more than $10.6 billion to rehabilitate, replace, and upgrade roofs, facades, mechanical systems, and building layouts across the City’s portfolio, to promote public use and improve government efficiency.We will continue the implementation of the City’s sweeping green buildings plan, retrofitting all public buildings to become more efficient by 2025. We will spend $604 million to rehabilitate dozens of libraries, more than $7.6 billion for school buildings, and $432million to improve cultural facilities.

        h2 Project Spotlight: The Brooklyn-Queen Expressway Triple Cantilever
        p. 
          The Department of Transportation is planning to invest to bring the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE), a nearly half-mile long triple-cantilever structure, to a state of good repair.This segment of the BQE is a critical link of I-278, the sole interstate highway that connects Brooklyn with Queens and the Bronx, New England to the northeast, and Staten Island and New Jersey to the southwest. This corridor is crucial to passenger and freight movement, as it is part of a heavily utilized truck route for both first and last mile delivery. This project is part of a larger $1.9 billion program to rehabilitate the BQE, from Sands Street on the east and Atlantic Avenue on the south. The BQE project presents significant benefits for the regional transportation network and local residents alike, including safer travel, a quieter roadway, improved ridability, more connectivity, better drainage, and pleasing aesthetics. Construction on this project is expected to begin in 2021 and complete in 2026.
