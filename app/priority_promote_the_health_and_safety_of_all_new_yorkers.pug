        h1 Promote the health and safety of all New Yorkers
        p.
          We will protect the well-being of all New Yorkers through investments in world-class public health facilities, policing and emergency response infrastructure, and public realm improvements. We are revitalizing our health and hospitals system to ensure New Yorkers have access to state-of the-art preventative care and medical treatment. We are also focused on enhancing safety in our city through a multi-faceted approach to ensure that we are reducing the occurrences of crimes, injuries, and fatalities, particularly for vulnerable populations.
        p.
          We will modernize our hospital facilities, in order to offer cutting-edge healthcare through $56 million of investment. This includes funding allocated to new medical equipment, such as CT scanners, ensuring New Yorkers have access to the latest treatment options. We will also promote preventative measures by encouraging active lifestyles by expanding access to active transport through investment in bicycle and pedestrian programs.

            h4 Initiative Spotlight: Vision Zero
            p Each year in NYC, over 250 people are killed and 4,000 are seriously injured in traffic crashes. The majority of those killed are foot—they could be people headed to work, walking home, out playing, heading to a subway, or waiting for a bus. DOT is partnering with other City agencies to no longer regard serious crashes as inevitable and pursue interventions that can mitigate traffic safety risks, especially for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. DOT will dedicate $1.5billion in this Ten-Year Capital Strategy to Vision Zero projects, which include safety engineering improvements along roadways and at intersections, as well as enhanced street lighting and traffic signals. These capital projects will complement operational enhancements and legislation to make our streets safe for all New Yorkers.

          In addition to strengthening our healthcare system, we will protect our communities and promote public safety by equipping our police officers, fire fighters, and correctional officers with infrastructure and facilities to respond to neighborhood needs. We will invest $2 billion in the City’s central information technology infrastructure to ensure that it continues to be up to date, reliable, resilient, and scalable, as well as secure from cyber-threats and natural disasters.
        p.
          We will also safeguard the well-being of vulnerable populations including the elderly, disabled, homeless, and incarcerated who continue to face disproportionate threats to their well-being. These efforts include continuing the expansion of Vision Zero for improved traffic safety for seniors and the disabled with accessible pedestrian signal and ramp improvements. We are also renovating 30 existing homeless shelters to increase capacity and improve the quality of shelter facilities.
        p.
          In total, we plan to invest heavily in safeguarding the health of New Yorkers and promoting public safety for generations to come.
