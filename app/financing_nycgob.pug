          The refunding transaction the City has completed to date in fiscal year 2017 generated approximately $130 million of debt service savings during the financial plan period.

          In addition to the total issuance mentioned above, the City took steps to manage its outstanding floating rate debt. The City reoffered four subseries of floating rate bonds amounting to over $200 million. Of those reoffered issues, two subseries of publicly offered floating rate notes amounting to approximately $150 million and two subseries of variable rate demand bonds amounting to approximately $50 million were converted to fi xed rates.

          The City plans to issue GO bonds for capital purposes of approximately $3.3 billion, $4.5 billion, $4.7 billion, and $4.6 billion in fiscal years 2018 through 2021, respectively.

          Currently the debt service for the City, TFA FTS, and City appropriation debt, or conduit debt, excluding the effect of pre payments, is 7.4 percent of the Cityâ€™s total budgeted revenues in fiscal year 2017. That ratio is projected to rise to 9.0 percent in fiscal year 2021. As a percentage of tax revenues, the debt service ratio is 11.5 percent in fiscal year 2017 and is projected to increase to 13.1 percent in fiscal year 2021.
