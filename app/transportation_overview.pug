          h1 Department of Transportation
          p.
            The Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in New York City. To fulfill this mission, DOT builds and maintains streets, sidewalks, highways, bridges, and municipal parking facilities; maintains and operates municipal ferry systems and monitors private ferry systems; monitors private bus companies; promotes the use of sustainable modes of transportation; participates in traffic regulation efforts; and serves as an advocate for better and safer transportation. 
          p.
            Although future demands on the transportation network will depend on a host of economic, demographic, and social trends that are difficult to predict, all indicators point to an increasing transportation demand. Increasing congestion on the City&#8217;s highways will further exacerbate the difficulties of goods movement, as most goods are shipped into the City via trucks. In the face of these trends the challenge will be to channel as much of this rising demand into mass transit as possible, while still maintaining a viable and safe local street system. Simultaneously, the City must maintain its aging bridge and arterial network so that vital transportation links do not become structurally deficient or congested, and to limit pollution-causing bottlenecks, which can impede the City&#8217;s economic growth.

          h3 Ten-Year Capital Strategy
          p.
