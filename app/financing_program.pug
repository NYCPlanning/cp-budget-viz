            h4 Initiative Spotlight. Increasing School Broadband Connectivity
            p Having technology in our classrooms not only makes learning exciting, but also prepares our students to succeed in the jobs of today and tomorrow. With the technology sector projected to continue to add a large portion of jobs to the economy, having a strong technology foundation is crucial to equipping students with critical skills to be at the forefront of technological innovation. The School Construction Authority’s 2015-19 5-Year Capital Plan allocates $650 million for technology, $192 million of which is for FY18 alone. Funding will help carve the path for schools to upgrade their broadband internet access to ensure that schools can accept the faster internet speeds. This equipment will facilitate the integration of hands-on and project-based activities into everyday learning, cultivating critical thinking skills and adding significant value to students’ academic growth.
