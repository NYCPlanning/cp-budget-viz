          h1 Financing Program
          p.
            The City financing program projects $53.3 billion of longterm borrowing for the period fiscal years 2019 through 2023 to support the current City capital program, excluding $737 million planned to be issued for education purposes through Building Aid Revenue Bonds (BARB). The portion of the capital program not financed by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (NYW or the Authority) will be split between General Obligation (GO) bonds of the City and Future Tax Secured (FTS) bonds of the New York City Transitional Finance Authority (TFA). Given the TFA is near its statutory limit on BARB debt outstanding, the financing program reflects BARB issuance so as to remain under the limit.
          p.
            The financing of the City capital program is split among GO, TFA FTS, NYW, and TFA BARB bond issuance. The City and TFA FTS expect to issue $20.7 billion and $23.9 billion, respectively, during the plan period. The City issuance supports 39 percent of the total, while TFA FTS issuance supports 45 percent of the total. NYW will issue approximately $8.7 billion.

            The financing of the City capital program is split among GO, TFA FTS and NYW bond issuance. The City and TFA expect to issue $19.4 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, during the plan period. The City issuance supports 40 percent of the total, while TFA FTS issuance supports 42 percent of the total. NYW will issue, excluding refundings, approximately $8.9 billion.
          p.
            The City, TFA, and NYW have enjoyed continued strong investor demand which has allowed the City capital program to be financed at reasonable interest rates. All of the issuers financing the City capital program have maintained credit ratings in the AA category or better by Moody&#8217;s, Standard & Poor&#8217;s, and Fitch, as indicated in the table above.
